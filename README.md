This script, as currently written, will access the gmail api and display all Labels in authenticated user's gmail.

A couple of requirements:

You must download your own credentials.json from GCP 

https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python this site will help you get your credentials.json

You must set env var GMAIL_CREDS to point to your credentials file
